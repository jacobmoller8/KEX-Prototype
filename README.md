## About the project

The project is a webapplication for a digital food inventory system. The application consist in three main parts: shopping/inventory/trash and we are doing the project as part of our bachelor degree project. The webapp is connected to a physical scanner that can read barcodes, which is the main use for the app (there is a link to a demonstration video of the scanner-system in the header of the app).

## API
